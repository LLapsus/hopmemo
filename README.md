# Hopfield Network

Hopfield Network is a simple neural associative memory, which is able to memorize a set of given images.

## Streamlit demo (alnum dataset)

Run:

`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

The app lets you sample alnum patterns (A–Z, 0–9), add them to the Hopfield network one-by-one, and observe how the weights change after each memorization step.
